# Gytis Daujotas

Hi! I live in San Francisco. I'm currently working at AtoB, a financial infrastructure startup for logistics. I previously interned at AWS and Stripe.

**I believe that massive input is superior to spaced repetition.** When information is almost free, only a vanishingly small fraction is worth paying attention to. [Bookshelf](books.html)

**I worked on a bunch of things.** Most of my stuff lives on [Github](https://github.com/gytdau)

**I'd love to talk.** Reach me here: [gytdau@gmail.com](mailto:gytdau@gmail.com)

Some of my posts:

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
