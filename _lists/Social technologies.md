# Social technologies

Social platforms have done a good job at becoming safer and more pleasant to use. This is an important effect, because commentary on how social platforms reveals the "dark side" of human nature is now outdated at best.


- WhatsApp prevented witch-hunts by [limiting how often a message could get shared](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/20180723-death-by-whatsapp-1283429-2018-07-13)
- Twitter built [a fair, reproducible, and examinable system](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/08/16/communitynotes.html) for users to add context to posts they see
- YouTube is much friendlier and nicer than it was in 2012, where there were frequent dislike brigades _(n.b. what did they do to make it so much better?)_

Some ideas for the future:

- Comment input boxes can show a squiggly line under things people say that are toxic or mean, allowing users to self-moderate
- Better language modeling can lead us to all sort of more advanced ranking policies
