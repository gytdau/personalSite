Generally, slavish scholarly pursuit isn't very useful. That said, the book medium has lasted for over 4,000 years, and I think it's still underrated how it can serve as a limitless tap into some of the best thinking our species has produced.

Generally, I've read less than half of these books. Books are dense and cheap, and my temperament to be slightly impatient with written content makes me a fan of the [massive input style of learning.](https://nintil.com/massive-input-spaced-repetition)
